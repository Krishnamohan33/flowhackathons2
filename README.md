Flow Coin Collector is an engaging 2D platformer game that incorporates the Flow SDK, a powerful software development kit. In this game, players control a character who navigates through a level, collecting coins scattered throughout. The Flow SDK integration allows for real-time score tracking and display.

As players collect coins, their score increases, and the updated score is communicated to the Flow platform using the Flow SDK. The game leverages the Flow SDK's signal system to send and receive score updates, providing a seamless and dynamic gaming experience. Players can see their score increasing as they progress through the level.

Flow Coin Collector demonstrates the potential of combining Unity game development with the Flow SDK. It showcases the integration of real-time score tracking and communication with the Flow platform, enabling developers to create interactive and immersive games that seamlessly interact with the Flow ecosystem.
